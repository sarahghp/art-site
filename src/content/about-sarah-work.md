 Resumes are often a limited way to tell a complex story. The classic PDF is linked here, but I recommend reading the narrative below if you have the time.

I am currently <span class="role-highlight">an engineer on the compilers team at [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/)</span>; delegate to TC39; and all around Javascript & SVG fan. I love working on complex systems and finding ways to make the experience of software — for both the final user and the developer — fun and enjoyable.

But my path here was a bit circuitous. 

After graduating from <span class="role-highlight">Brown University</span> with a degree in literary and critical theory, I worked in publishing for a few years, including almost three years as <span class="role-highlight">the first managing editor at Soft Skull Press</span>. In this role, I was responsible for making manuscripts into books: overseeing copyediting, typesetting, proofreading, and printing. Of course, since a small press is a lot like a startup, I also did a lot of this work myself. (Well, not the printing.)

Alas, much like a startup, Soft Skull eventually started running out of runway. I switched fields to do similar work as a <span class="role-highlight">technical project manager</span> in advertising, spending nearly three years at Fly Communications. Here I helped plan and oversee the creation of websites instead of books. I also created technical documentation for our custom CMS and learned about UX design. 

I liked the latter even more than project management, and when I left Fly, I worked as a <span class="role-highlight">UX designer, first in advertising in New York, and then for startups in San Francisco.</span> Here I began to focus on data design. I also started to learn to code.

This was spurred by spite, initially. I wanted to know if the engineers I worked with really couldn't build certain designs or just didn't want to. Also someone told me that Javascript was probably too hard for me to learn. But I figured if I could learn French, I could learn Javascript, and I dove in. Once I completed my first data art project, [a qualitative look at my book collection](http://shapeofmylibrary.com/), I was hooked. 

Starting in the fall of 2014, I took time out full-time work to focus on art and code, first at <span class="role-highlight">the School For Poetic Computation,</span> where I learned about compilers and esolangs, and then at <span class="role-highlight">Recurse Center</span> (aka Hacker School), where I deepened my knowledge. I created a library for p5.js under the auspices of <span class="role-highlight">Google Summer of Code</span> and enrolled in the <span class="role-highlight">masters program at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.</span> I completed my degree in Integrated Digital Media (a code and art hybrid) in 2017.

While in graduate school, I also <span class="role-highlight">interned at the Office for Creative Research,</span> a data visualization studio. There I primarily worked on a project that involved writing a new data visualization in Javascript every week, which is a fantastic way to make mistakes and learn from them in a tight loop.

My first full-time engineering role was on the <span class="role-highlight">payments and projects team at Kickstarter</span>. In addition to my day-to-day work, I contributed to internal projects such as the styleguide, RFC process, and front-end knowledge-sharing. I was <span class="role-highlight">promoted to senior engineer</span> a year after I started.

After leaving Kickstarter, I spent some time freelancing, working on art, and searching for the right next place. That place ended up being <span class="role-highlight">Gitlab, where I spent the majority of my time on the Verify team,</span> architecting and implementing functionality for Gitlab CI, including using my data-vis knowledge to craft a flexible update for links in the Gitlab pipeline graph.

I also served as a maintainer; mentored engineers; and brought in utility-style CSS  as part of the Gitlab UI working group. My project work covered a variety of areas, from greenfield spikes and exploration to refactoring complex legacy code in order to enable sustainable product growth. I led collaborations with backend engineers to speed up engineering work, improve performance, and allow us to remove outdated architectures; I also contributed upstream when necessary. I founded the frontend-observability working group and built the case for, architected, and oversaw the implementation of a new CI authoring section, which grew quickly on launch. Overall, I loved working alternately on long-term strategic projects; internal organization; and ongoing product updates.

These days, I work on Javascript-the-language, but I miss product engineering, so should I ever leave Igalia, it would be to return to product. 

In my free time, I make video art, perform as a live-code visualist, and sometimes even teach live-code workshops. To get away from the computer, I swim.
