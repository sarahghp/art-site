# Work With Sarah

I've been a <span class="role-highlight">frontend engineer</span> for nearly a decade, working primarily at mid-stage product-focused startups like <span class="role-highlight">Kickstarter</span> and <span class="role-highlight">Gitlab</span>. After a sojourn through Javascript language specification work with <span class="role-highlight">Igalia and TC39</span> and a stint as a founding engineer, I'm ready to get back to product work with proven market fit.

Things I love: <span class="role-highlight">architecture and planning;</span> code review and mentoring; <span class="role-highlight">design and component systems;</span> and untangling parts of the codebase that scare everyone else.

In my free time, I make [video art](/), perform as a live-code visualist, and sometimes even teach live-code workshops. To get away from the computer, I swim.
